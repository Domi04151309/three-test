# three-test 🚀🎨✨

A minimal Vite + TypeScript demo that mounts a Three.js scene and a first-person controller. Play around and enjoy the visuals! 🎮🌿

This repository is an experiment in "vibe coding" — exploring what's possible when AI generates most of the code and the human guides, reviews, and composes. The code in this project was created primarily with AI assistance rather than manual editing. 🧠✨🛠️

## Features 🌟

- Minimal Vite + TypeScript setup ⚡
- Three.js scene with a first-person controller 🎮
- Procedural terrain, plants, sky, and a simple renderer 🌄🌱
- Entry point: `src/main.ts` 📍

## Quick start ▶️

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open the app at `http://localhost:5173` and enjoy! 🔭

## Useful commands 🧰

- `npm run tsc` — Type-check ✅
- `npm run eslint` — Lint only 🔎
- `npm run lint` — Full lint/format checks 🧼

## Project layout 📁

- `src/` — TypeScript source
- `src/main.ts` — App entry
- `src/app/` — app components, player, renderer, terrain, sky, etc.
- `assets/` — static assets and styles 🎨

## Notes about the experiment 🧪🤖

This repo is intentionally an AI-driven experiment. The goals:

- See how far "vibe coding" can go using AI to create and assemble code. ✨
- Iterate quickly and learn where human review is still required. 🔁
- Share findings and patterns for future AI-assisted development. 🤖💡
